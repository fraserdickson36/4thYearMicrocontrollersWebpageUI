What is BBT?
We are a company striving to reduces the hurdles of customized home automation by providing you with the best hardware possible. However, to give you the freedom you deserve we developed the best web-application there is out there. Our cutting edge platform allows you to connect all your devices together seamlessly with recipes. Recipes are like small programs easy to make that allow your devices to operate together in way that wouldn’t be possible without them. For example, by creating a recipe you are able to have your office light flicker if someone rings the doorbell in case you have your headphones on.

Our Available Devices
We currently have 6 different devices compatible with our system. These are explained here:

Thermometer:

The thermometer device uses the MSP430G2553 and has 3 action peripherals. There are 4 trigger options that can be set to thermometer which varies from indicating when the temperature drops below 0 °C to when temperature goes above 35 °C. 3 possible action peripherals are Buzzer, RGB LED and regular LED. The user would be able to create a recipe which for example, would light RGB LED to red colour when temperature rises above 15 °C or trigger a buzzer if temperature rises above 35 °C.

Doorbell:

The doorbell device is created by both MSP430G2553 and MSP430FR4133 devices and has 2 different action peripherals. The user could create a simple recipe which would lead in pressing a button to trigger a buzzer or could go with more interactive recipes. For example, pressing a button would start a buzzer but pressing it twice in rapid fashion would also lead in lighting up LED.

Bathroom RGB Light:

Although it is called "Bathroom RGB Light" this device could be used in any room! The device is created for MSP430G2553 board which connects a button and RGB light. The user could create multiple recipes to control the colour of the light in your room with different button presses.

Smart LED:

This device allows the user to select from our range of trigger peripherals to control LEDs in his house to have the maximum amount of control for lighting in the house. Created for both boards, this device allows the user to have seamless connection with our devices. If you want to dim the lights in the room when the temperature reaches certain threshold, it is not a problem with this device!

Smart button:

Following the same idea as for "Smart LED", we give our users the ability to connect to any of their devices with smart button. This allows the user to control multiple devices in the house with smart buttons giving freedom to set your devices the way you want it. If that light in your room is too bright for a relaxing evening, now it can be dimmed with a simple push of the button.

Wall mounted dial with dimmable LEDs:

One of the most common smart devices used in smart homes these days. Created for both MSP430FR4133 and MSP430G2553, this device allows the user to be very precise with brightness of a room. By turning the knob, the user can set up to 10 different brightness levels for the lights.
